# dotfiles
My hidden files

Im Felix den Heijer, a student at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam studying Communication and Multimedia design. This dotfiles repository includes the files that are hidden with a "." on my computer. 

These are all of my dot files that belong in the root directory of my computer. Terminal will automatically run .bash_profile when opened, and in my bash profile there is some code that will open .bashrc directly. Then bashrc will tell you the weather and change your prompt.

Again if you want to install these files yourself, then just move them to the root directory (~) of your computer and keep them hidden with the "mv" command.
