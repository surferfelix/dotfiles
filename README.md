# dotfiles
My hidden files

These are all of my dot files that belong in the root directory of my computer. Terminal will automatically run .bash_profile when 
opened, and in my bash profile there is some code that will open .bashrc directly. Then bashrc will tell you the weather and change
your prompt.
